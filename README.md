In today’s world, we are always striving for building applications which can adapt to constantly changing needs. 
We want our systems to flexible, resilient, scalable and withstand end user’s high expectations. 
Considering these needs, a Reactive Manifesto was put together, with best practices which will help us build robust applications. 
Following four pillars makes a strong base of reactive application.

Responsive
Resilient
Elastic
Message Driven

The solution to build this kind of architecture is to adapt design patterns across the industry.

Here I am Sharing my knowledge with Design patterns, their applications, when to use them with live coded examples in c++.

Design Patterns:

1. Factory Design Pattern
2. Abstract Factory Design Pattern
3. Singleton Design Pattern
4. Observer Design Pattern
5. Prototype Design Pattern
6. Builder Design Pattern

Each directory has a code and a docx explaining about the design patttern, it's uses, code with comments for better understanding, an UML Diagram, practical applications and some resources/references from where you can learn and explore more.
